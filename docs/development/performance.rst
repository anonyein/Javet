Javet Performance
=================

In V8, a context is an execution environment that allows separate, unrelated, JavaScript applications to run in a single instance of V8.

It's recommended to reset context if a new execution environment is required.

Performance Comparisons of Node.js Mode and V8 Mode
===================================================

Here is the performance test result from i7 10700K + Windows 10. Test case is just ``1 + 1 = 2``.

Highlights
----------

* Node.js performs slightly better in **Single Context** mode mainly because the V8 embedded in Node.js is much older than the built-in V8.
* Built-in V8 dramatically outperforms Node.js in **Ad-hoc** mode mainly because Node.js comes with a huge overhead that seriously slows down the context and isolate creation and recycle.
* It's recommended to use built-in V8 unless Node.js is required in some particular cases.
* Node.js on Linux is built as `position independent code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code>`_ which comes with an additional performance overhead.

Java VS Wasm Benchmarks
=======================

When to use Java bindings and when to use Wasm (WebAssembly) is quite a concern. The `Programming-Language-Benchmarks <https://github.com/hanabi1224/Programming-Language-Benchmarks>`_ provides decent `benchmarks <https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/java-vs-wasm>`_ between Java and Wasm.

Here is a summary of the benchmarks generated on Jul 13, 2023.

.. note::

    Both benchmarks are not JIT optimized because there's no warm-up. So, the actual performance could be much higher. And further benchmarks are needed to measure the performance of the JIT.

Please choose the code behind technology based on the actual benchmarks because according to the tests the performance difference is not significant and depends on the particular algorithms. However, please be aware that Wasm comes with some drawbacks.

* The Wasm code size is considerable. e.g. An HelloWorld Wasm package written in rust is 21+KB (.js 4+KB + .wasm 16+KB). Fetching the files from storage, parsing and compiling the files also takes considerable amount of time which may eventually slow down the whole execution.
* Wasm code initialization and execution is asynchronous which means the business logic has to deal with ``async``, ``await`` or ``Promise`` and ``V8Runtime.await()`` has to be called. The Java bindings can be either synchronous or asynchronous. That's more flexible.
* External Wasm applications are like a black box to the server side applications. Enabling external Wasm execution implies some security vulnerabilities.
